Python Shell in NodeJS
====================================================
A light-weight application to invoke python
program in nodeJS. This application is developed in
my workplace for faciliating the work of colleagues 
who cannot code. The source codes are now under 
reorganization.

Purpose of this project
----------------------------------------------------
1. Execute a python program without ssh
2. Sending the stdin and stdout from python to
user for interaction
3. Multi-background python shell (Not implemented yet)
4. Logging the output from python (Not implemented yet)

Warning
----------------------------------------------------
The source has not yet reorganized after launching
in my work place. The functionality may not be completed
or bug-free. Welcome anyone who are interested in 
nodeJS to contribute.
